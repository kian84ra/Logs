# Log Standards
  Log standards define how logs should be generated, transmitted, and stored. They ensure consistency, interoperability, and compliance across systems.

# Common Event Expression (CEE)
     Developer: MITRE
     Purpose: Standardizes log structure for easier analysis
     Features:
       - Common taxonomy for event data
       - Supports both structured and unstructured logs
     Use Case: Cross-platform log correlation

# OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet
     Focus: Security logging for developers
     Key Recommendations:
       - Log all authentication attempts
       - Record sensitive operations
       - Protect log integrity
     Example:
     ```log
       2023-09-08T22:10:00Z SECURITY WARN [auth] Failed login: user=admin source=10.10.133.168

# Syslog Protocol (RFC 5424)
     Components:
       - Facility code (e.g., `auth=4`, `cron=9`)
       - Severity level (0=Emergency to 7=Debug)
     Example:
     ```log
       <34>1 2023-09-08T22:10:00Z WEBSRV-02 sshd 1234 - Password accepted for damianhall

 # NIST SP 800-92
     Key Requirements:
       - Retain logs for ≥90 days (compliance)
       - Implement cryptographic integrity protection
       - Centralized log collection
     Retention Tiers:
       | Tier | Retention | Accessibility |
       |------|-----------|---------------|
       | Hot  | 0-3 months| Immediate     |
       | Warm | 3-24 months| 5 min recall  |
       | Cold | 2-5 years | 24h recall    |

# Cloud-Specific Standards
     Azure Monitor Logs:
       - Uses Kusto Query Language (KQL)
       - Auto-collects 90+ service logs
     Google Cloud Logging:
       - Logs routed through Cloud Pub/Sub
       - Supports Logs Explorer
     Oracle Cloud (OCI) Logging:
       - Unified service for all OCI resources
       - Integrated with Oracle Functions
